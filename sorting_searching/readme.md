# Sorting 

Sorting is not a problem-solving technique per see but as you have seen in the previous sections we have been able to solve many problems by either sorting the input or assuming it was sorted and then applying one of the other techniques.

When you are facing a new problem, ask yourself:

- Can I sort the input?. For example, sometimes you have to return indices, therefore sorting is not an option
- How would this problem change if the elements were sorted?
- How does sorting affect the overall complexity?. The best sorting algorithms have a complexity of O(n log n) â€“ sorting integers can be done in O(n)
