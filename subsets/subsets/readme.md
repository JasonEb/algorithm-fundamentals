# Subsets with Power sets

Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

## Notes
This problem challenged my understanding of jests and javascript assignment. Couldn't find a deep equality matching with Jest at the moment, but it forced me to understand my algorithm deeper and write out much more specific tests that reflected my own thinking, instead of a broad and general test result.
