# Dynamid Programming

## Steps to solve a dynamic programming problem
Unfortunately, there is no universal recipe to solve a dynamic programming problem. You need to go through many problems until you start getting the hang of it. Do not get discouraged. This is hard. Maybe the hardest type of problems you will face in an interview. This is about modeling a problem with relatively simple tools â€“ no need for fancy data structures or algorithms.

I have solved tons of them and still, sometimes I find it difficult to get to the solution. The more you practice, the easier it will be. This is the closest to a recipe to solve dynamic programming problems:

- Prove overlapping subproblems and suboptimal structure properties.
- Define subproblems.
- Define recursion.
- Code your top-down or bottom-up dynamic programming solution.
