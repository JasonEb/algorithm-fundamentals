# Two Sums
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/


Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Notes:

- Algorithm demonstrates how to traverse with 2 points on a sorted list.
- 3 sum implementation can involve an additional probe/pointer that will iterate the "gap" between the two pointers. What would be the runtime?
