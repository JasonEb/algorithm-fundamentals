# Two Sums

## Utilizing Two Pointers
This technique is very useful on sorted arrays and arrays whose elements we want to group.

The idea is to use two (or more pointers) to split the array into different areas or groups based on some condition:

Elements smaller than, equal to and greater than a certain value
Elements whose sum is too small or too large.
